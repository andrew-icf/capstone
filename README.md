# Capstone
 I wanted to build a Native Application using React-Native, so I designed and developed this project to familiarize myself with iOS tech and to couple this with my React projects. It is not yet on the app store but should be shortly.
 
 # How to Use
  Download react-native and run using react-native run-ios. I am using the react-native npm and xCode to build it out locally.
